"""
Use try and except statements
Check for IO errors
Check for value errors

Copy your file from the previous exercise (Average numbers) and modify it so that it handles the following exceptions:

It should handle any IOError exceptions that are raised when the file is opened and data is read from it.
It should handle any ValueError exceptions that are raised
when the items that are read from the file are converted to a number.
