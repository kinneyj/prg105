"""
Creating lists
Processing lists
Finding min and max values
Finding and using index values
Copy program 4.3 into the chapter 7 folder and rename it as "7-1-Rainfall-Statistics"

Modify the program so that the rainfall for each month is stored into a list.
Eliminate the user's ability to select the number of years, you will just work with one year's data.
The program should calculate and display the total rainfall for the year, the average monthly rainfall the year,
and the months with the highest and lowest amounts of rain for the year.
Hint: convert months to a list so you can use the index value to print the max and min months.
