Using Functions
Returning values from functions and storing them in variables

A nutritionist who works for a fitness club helps members by evaluating their diets. As part of her evaluation,
she asks members for the number of fat grams, carbohydrate grams, and protein grams that they consumed in a day.
Then, she calculates the number of calories that result from the fat, using the following formula:

calories from fat = fat grams X 9

Next, she calculates the number of calories that result from the carbohydrates, using the following formula:

calories from carbs = carb grams X 4

Next, she calculates the number of calories that result from the proteins, using the following formula:

calories from protein = protein grams X 4

Use a different function for each nutrient to make calculations by nutrient, and print the calories for that nutrient on screen.
Return the results from each function to variables in the main method.
Add the variables in the main method to display the total calories for the day.
