# TODO 11.1 Introduction to Inheritance

# You are going to create a Dwelling class based on the
# Automobile sample from the chapter

# 1) Create the class Dwelling, the __init__ method should accept number_of_rooms, square_feet, floors
class Dwelling:
    def __init__(self, number_of_rooms, square_feet, floors):
        self.number_of_rooms = number_of_rooms

    def set_number_of_rooms(self, num_room):
        self.number_of_rooms = num_room

    def set_square_feet(self, num_sq_ft):
        self.square_feet = num_sq_ft

    def set_floors(self, floorNum):
        self.floors = floorNum

    # 3) Add accessors for all of the data attributes
    def get_number_of_rooms(self):
        return self.number_of_rooms

    def get_square_feet(self):
        return self.square_feet

    def get_floors(self):
        return self.floors


# 4) Create the class Single_family_home as a sub class of Dwelling
# The __init__ method should accept number_of_rooms, square_feet, floors, garage_type, yard_size
# -- Call the __init__ of superclass Dwelling and pass the required arguments, remember to include self
# -- Initialize the garage_type and yard_size attributes

class Single_family_home(Dwelling):

    # 5) Create the mutator and accessor methods for the garage_type and yard_size attributes
    def set_garage_type(self, garage_type):
        self.garage_type = garage_type

    def get_garage_type(self, yard_size):
        self.yard_size = yard_size

    def set_yard_size(self, yard_size):
        self.yard_size = yard_size

    def get_yard_size(self):
        return self.yard_size


# 6) Demonstrate the Single_family_home class, no need to import because you are in the same file

# 7) Create an object from the Single_family_home class with the following information:
# 6 rooms, 1200 square feet, 1 floor, single car garage, .25 acres
home = Single_family_home(6, 1200, 1, 'Single car garage', '.25 Acres')
# 8) Display the data using the accessor methods
print('rooms: ', home.get_number_of_rooms())
print('Square Feet:', home.get_square_feet())
print('floors: ', home.get_garage_type(yard_size=set))
print('garage type: ', home.get_garage_type(yard_size=set))
print('Yard size: ', home.get_yard_size())

# 9) Create a main function. Call the main function

        Mammal.__init__(self, 'Mouse')

    def make_sounf(self):

# 3) Create a Bird class as a sub class of the mammal class following the Cat Example
class Bird(Mammal):
    def __init__(self):
        Mammal.__init__(self, 'Bird')

    def make_sound(self):
        print('Chirp')


# 4) Follow the example in program 11-10 (no need to import, use main2 instead of main
#    because there is already a main on this page) use the Mouse and Bird class that you created
