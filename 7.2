"""
Pass and return lists

use for loops for processing lists

Have a function that creates a list of 20 random integers between 1 and 100
(Assign them dynamically, store the list in a variable.)

Have a function get a number from the user that is between 1 and 100
(validate to ensure a number between 1 and 100 was entered instead of text
or something out of range using a try and except statement).

Pass both the list and the user's number to a function
and have it display all numbers in the list that is greater than the user's number.
If there are not any, display a message that explains there are no numbers in the list greater than the entered number.
