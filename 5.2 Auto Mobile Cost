"""
Write a program that asks the user to enter the monthly costs for the following expenses incurred from operating
his or her automobile: loan payment, insurance, gas, and maintenance.
The program should then display the total monthly cost of these expenses,
and the total annual cost of these expenses.

main(): 3

# calls the other functions
# main is traditionally used as the first function in a program to organize the flow of the program logic

monthly():  1

# Gather information from the user
# Accumulate the total in a local variable
# Print the monthly costs on screen, formatted appropriately for money
# Pass the monthly cost to Function 2

yearly(monthly_total):  2

# Accepts a float parameter
# Calculates yearly cost by multiplying the monthly cost by 12
# Displays the yearly cost on screen, formatted appropriately for money

output:
How much do you pay for your car loan each month? 423.00
How much do you pay for your car insurance each month? 89
How much do you spend on gas each month? 80
What is the average amount you spend on maintenance monthly? 60
You spend $652.00 on your car each month.
You spend $7,824.00 per year on your car.
