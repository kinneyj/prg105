Search for values in listsThen, write a program that reads the contents of the two files into two separate lists.
The user should be able to enter a boy's name or a girl's name. The application should check both lists,
and then display messages indicating whether the names were among the most popular
if the name was on one of the lists or that the name was not on the lists of popular names.
