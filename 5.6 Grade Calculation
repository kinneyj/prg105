"""
Write a program using multiple functions
Pass parameters
Return values
Write a program that asks a user to enter five test scores. You will need to create five variables to hold these scores.

The purpose of this assignment is to get practice passing information between functions,
this is not a good example of the way programs are really written,
but it will help you to understand how to pass parameters.

Hint: if you have your mouse pointer at the end of a line you would like to copy,
Ctrl + d on windows or cmd + d on a mac will duplicate the line.
main -

asks the user for each of the five test scores, stores them in separate variables (score1, score2, etc)
calls calc_average and passes the five variables, storing the result in a variable
average = calc_average(score1, score2, score....
calls determine_grade, passing it the average variable, storing the result in a variable
prints the letter grade
calc_average -

This function should accept the five test scores as arguments
returns the average of the scores.
determine_grade -

This function should accept the average of the test scores as an argument
returns a letter grade based on the following scale:
