A mobile phone service provider has three different subscription packages for its customers:

Package A:	For $39.99 per month 450 minutes are provided. Additional minutes are $0.45 per minute.

Package B:	For $59.99 per month 900 minutes are provided. Additional minutes are $0.40 per minute.

Package C:	For $69.99 per month unlimited minutes provided.
Write a program that calculates a customer's monthly bill.

It should ask which package the customer has purchased and how many minutes were used.

It should then display the total amount due. Use a dollar sign and two decimal places for currency.
