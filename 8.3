"""
Use the .upper function
Use loops with strings
Use lists with strings
Write a program that lets the user enter a string and displays the letter that appears most frequently in the string.
Ignore spaces, punctuation, and uppercase vs lowercase.

Hints:

Create a list to hold letters based on the length of the user input
Convert all letters to the same case
Use a loop to check for each letter in the alphabet (create an alphabet list and step through it)
Have a variable to hold the largest number of times a letter appears, and replace the value when a higher number is found
