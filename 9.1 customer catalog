"""
Write a CRUD - Create, Read, Update, Delete application
Pickle files and save them
Unpickle and save into data structures

Write a program that keeps names and email addresses in a dictionary as key-value pairs.
The program should display a menu that lets the user look up a person's email address,
add a new name and email address, change an existing email address, and delete an existing name and email address.
The program should pickle the dictionary and save it to a file when the user exits the program.
Each time the program starts, it should retrieve the dictionary from the file and unpickle it.
